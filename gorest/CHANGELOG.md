## v1.4.0 [Jan 07 - 2022]

**Breaking changes!!** If your application is built on one of the previous releases, you need to
do some adjustments to your codes before switching to v1.4.

- Features from development branch `v1.4.0-alpha0` are merged into v1.4
- To build a new RESTful application, you do not need to clone this full repository anymore. It is
  recommended to add the required packages as dependencies
- v1.4 is now pretty solid for any future RESTful application development
- In the upcoming days a full tutorial will be published on how to use `GoREST` packages as
  dependency to build any simple or complex applications within the shortest possible time

Development branch: v1.4.0-alpha0 [Jan 02 - 2022]

Safety: Zero-logs policy for the test server (demo live API)

- If the client is a web browser, or when the client requests to
  serve HTML pages, the API will serve HTML page instead of JSON
- Template files are located in `templates` directory
- Template engine: `Pongo2` - similar syntax like Django
- Templates developed for:
  - `GET` - `/api/v1/posts/:id`: [live demo] https://goapi.pilinux.me/api/v1/posts/1

[Jan 07 - 2022]

- `Render` is now an exported function placed in `lib` package
- `Render` moved from `lib` to `renderer` package
- Config modified for `Basic Auth`
- Demo router added - how to implement `Basic Auth`
  - `GET` - `/api/v1/access_resources`: [live demo] https://goapi.pilinux.me/api/v1/access_resources
    with `USERNAME=test_username` and `PASSWORD=secret_password`
- App firewall added
  - to allow all IPs, set `IP=*`
  - to allow one or several IPs, set `LISTTYPE=whitelist` and `IP=[IPv4 addresses]`
  - to block one or several IPs, set `LISTTYPE=blacklist` and `IP=[IPv4 addresses]`

## v1.3.1 [Dec 31 - 2021]

- During the login process, if the provided email is not found,
  API should handle it properly
- A user must not be able to modify resources related to other users
  (controllers have been updated)

## v1.3.0 [Dec 28 - 2021]

- refactored config files to reduce cyclomatic complexity
- organized instance variables

## v1.2.7 [Dec 27 - 2021]

- REDIS database driver and test endpoints added
- removed ineffectual assignments
- check errors during binding of incoming JSON

## v1.2.6 [Dec 26 - 2021]

## v1.2.2 [Jul 29 - 2021]

- Replaced `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go` with `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt`

Package `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go <= v3.2.0` allows attackers to bypass
intended access restrictions in situations with []string{} for m["aud"]
(which is allowed by the specification).
